# Welcome

Own your stack. No surprise bills.

EasyRunner is a simple, self-managed single-server app hosting solution for solopreneurs and indie hackers who want predictable costs and full control. You provide an Ubuntu server; EasyRunner configures it and deploys your apps securely over SSH. No control plane, no managed backend, no agent — just your server and the EasyRunner CLI.

Why people choose EasyRunner

- Predictable pricing: you run your own server, so there are no unexpected hosting fees.
- Self-hosted, agent-less: EasyRunner connects via SSH from the CLI and configures your server — no persistent agents or third-party control planes.
- Open stack: built entirely on open-source components.
- Fast to get started: bring an Ubuntu server and the CLI handles configuration and deployment.

How it works

1. You provide an Ubuntu server (cloud VM, VPS, or bare metal).
2. Use the EasyRunner CLI to connect over SSH.
3. EasyRunner configures the server and deploys your app securely.
