# How It Works

1. You provide an Ubuntu server (cloud VM, VPS, or bare metal).
2. Install the EasyRunner CLI on your laptop.
3. EasyRunner configures the server and deploys your app securely.

## Why you should choose EasyRunner

- Predictable pricing: you run your own server, so there are no unexpected hosting fees.
- Self-hosted, agent-less: EasyRunner connects via SSH from the CLI and configures your server â€” no persistent agents or third-party control planes.
- Open stack: built entirely on open-source components.
- Fast to get started: bring an Ubuntu server and the CLI handles configuration and deployment.


!!! Note

    EasyRunner is still an alpha version, meaning it's being rapidly developed therefore unstable.
