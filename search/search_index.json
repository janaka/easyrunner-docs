It provides simple deployment using SSH with end-to-end encryption, offering predictable costs without surprise charges or pricing changes. The architecture keeps things simple and secure: EasyRunner CLI connects to your server over SSH, giving you full control over your infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"faq/#what-do-i-need-to-use-easyrunner","title":"What do I need to use EasyRunner?","text":"<p>You need an Ubuntu server (any VPS provider like DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, or Hetzner) and the EasyRunner CLI installed on your local machine. The CLI connects to your server via SSH to handle setup and deployments automatically and securely.</p> <p>EasyRunner can also automate launching new servers on your VPS provider account. Currently supports Hetzner.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#is-easyrunner-difficult-to-set-up","title":"Is EasyRunner difficult to set up?","text":"<p>No. EasyRunner is designed for quick setup. Once you have an Ubuntu server, you install the CLI tool and initialise your server using the root account. The entire process takes minutes, not hours, and includes security best practices and CIS Level 1 server hardening by default.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#can-i-use-easyrunner-if-im-not-a-devops-expert","title":"Can I use EasyRunner if I'm not a DevOps expert?","text":"<p>Yes. EasyRunner is exactly for you. It simplifies server management so you don't need deep DevOps knowledge. If you're comfortable with basic command-line operations and have deployed code before, you can use EasyRunner. Basic security configurations are handled automatically during setup.</p> <p>Never the less it's recommended that you learn the concepts over time so you aren't blindly trusting tools.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#why-is-easyrunner-a-cli-does-easyrunner-have-a-web-ui","title":"Why is EasyRunner a CLI? Does EasyRunner have a web UI?","text":"<p>EasyRunner is a CLI by design for two key reasons: first, it makes setup and usage straightforward without complex dependencies. Second, you don't have to depend on hosting a web UI or rely on us to host one for you, keeping your infrastructure truly independent. In the future, we may provide a web UI as an optional add-on for those who prefer a graphical interface.</p> <p>Think of the CLI as your escape hatch for independence by design.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#pricing-costs","title":"Pricing &amp; Costs","text":""},{"location":"faq/#how-much-does-easyrunner-cost","title":"How much does EasyRunner cost?","text":"<p>EasyRunner has predictable pricing with no hidden fees or surprise charges.
